# Gradle Build Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix Gradle build issues in the Android indoor positioning application.

## Type Inference Error Fixes

### 1. Changed `create` to `register` in signingConfigs

In the `app/build.gradle.kts` file, we changed the `create` method to `register` in the signingConfigs block to fix a type inference error:

```diff
signingConfigs {
-    create("release") {
+    register("release") {
        // For CI environment, we'll use environment variables
        // For local development, we'll use the debug keystore
        storeFile = file("debug.keystore")
        storePassword = "android"
        keyAlias = "androiddebugkey"
        keyPassword = "android"
    }
}
```

### 2. Changed `create` to `register` in buildTypes

Similarly, we changed the `create` method to `register` in the buildTypes block for the staging build type:

```diff
buildTypes {
    // ... other build types ...
    
-    create("staging") {
+    register("staging") {
        initWith(getByName("release"))
        applicationIdSuffix = ".staging"
        versionNameSuffix = "-staging"
        isMinifyEnabled = true
        isShrinkResources = true
        matchingFallbacks += listOf("release")
    }
}
```

## Error Details

The original error was:
```
Cannot infer type for type parameter 'S'. Specify it explicitly.
```

This error occurred because the Gradle Kotlin DSL couldn't infer the type parameter for the `create` method. By using `register` instead, which has better type inference capabilities, we were able to fix the issue.

## Build Verification

The application was successfully built on macOS using:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

These changes improve the cross-platform compatibility of the build scripts, making them work correctly on both Windows and macOS environments.
