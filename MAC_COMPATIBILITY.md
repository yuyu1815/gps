# macOS Compatibility Changes

This document outlines the changes made to make the Android indoor positioning application compatible with macOS development environments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated SDK Path in local.properties

Changed the Android SDK path from Windows format to macOS format:

```diff
- sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\schoo\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
+ sdk.dir=/Users/yuyu/Library/Android/sdk
```

### 2. Fixed Gradle Wrapper Configuration

Updated the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file to include all required properties:

```diff
#Tue Aug 05 12:37:35 GMT+09:00 2025
+ distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
+ distributionPath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.11.1-bin.zip
+ zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
+ zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
```

### 3. Added Gradle Wrapper Script

Created the `gradlew` shell script for Unix/macOS systems and made it executable:

```bash
chmod +x gradlew
```

### 4. Generated Debug Keystore

Created a proper debug keystore for app signing:

```bash
rm app/debug.keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore app/debug.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -dname "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"
```

## Build Verification

The application was successfully built on macOS using:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Known Issues

- Full build with tests (`./gradlew build`) currently fails due to test configuration issues
- There are some deprecation warnings in the code that should be addressed in future updates

## Next Steps

1. Fix test configuration to allow running tests on macOS
2. Update deprecated API usages in the codebase
3. Consider adding CI/CD support for macOS builds
