# Performance Optimization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the performance optimizations implemented in the Android Indoor Positioning Application to improve battery efficiency, memory usage, and overall performance during long-running sessions.

## 1. Memory Optimization for Long-Running Sessions

- **Position History Downsampling**: Implemented automatic downsampling of older position data to reduce memory usage while preserving recent high-resolution data
- **Time-Based Cleanup**: Added automatic removal of position data older than 24 hours
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Used LinkedList for position history to optimize add/remove operations
- **Memory Limits**: Implemented maximum history size (1000 entries) to prevent excessive memory usage

## 2. Efficient Data Structures for Position Calculation

- **Custom Data Structures**: Created specialized data structures (WeightedBeacon, BeaconCalculationCache, GdopVector) to avoid redundant calculations
- **Reduced Allocations**: Minimized object allocations in performance-critical paths like triangulation
- **Array-Based Calculations**: Used arrays instead of collections for better performance in mathematical operations
- **In-Place Sorting**: Implemented efficient in-place sorting for beacon selection

## 3. Background Processing Optimization

- **WorkManager Integration**: Created BackgroundProcessingManager using WorkManager for efficient background task scheduling
- **Periodic Tasks**: Implemented workers for data cleanup, beacon health checks, and log cleanup
- **Battery-Aware Scheduling**: Configured tasks to run only when battery is not low
- **Automatic Initialization**: Added initialization during application startup

## 4. Low-Power Mode for Extended Usage

- **Power Management**: Created LowPowerMode class to centralize power-saving decisions
- **Battery Integration**: Updated BatteryOptimizer to work with low-power mode
- **Automatic Activation**: Implemented automatic activation based on battery level
- **User Controls**: Added UI components for manual control of low-power mode
- **Scan Optimization**: Reduced scan frequency and duration in low-power mode

## 5. Additional Optimizations

- **Static Detection**: Implemented detection of device stationary state to reduce unnecessary updates
- **Dynamic Scanning**: Added dynamic scanning intervals based on movement and battery state
- **Log File Management**: Created automatic log file cleanup to prevent excessive disk usage
- **Dependency Injection**: Updated ServiceModule to provide optimized components

## Impact

These optimizations significantly improve the application's performance and battery efficiency during long-running sessions, making it more suitable for extended indoor positioning use cases.
