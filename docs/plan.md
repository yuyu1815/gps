**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-08-05  
**Author:** JetBrains Junie

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the Android indoor positioning application that uses BLE beacons and smartphone sensors for high-precision location tracking in indoor environments where GPS is unavailable. The plan is based on an analysis of the project's current state and requirements as specified in the project documentation.

## 1. Core Positioning System Improvements

### 1.1 BLE Beacon Scanning Enhancement

**Current Challenges:**
- RSSI values fluctuate significantly due to environmental factors
- Beacon staleness management is critical for accurate positioning
- Multipath problems cause signal reflection and inaccurate distance calculations

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Implement robust RSSI filtering using moving average filters to smooth signal fluctuations
- Develop a beacon staleness management system that considers beacons invalid after 5+ seconds without updates
- Add dynamic scanning intervals based on user movement (more frequent when moving, less frequent when stationary)
- Implement TxPower calibration for beacons by measuring RSSI at 1m distance

**Rationale:**
The foundation of accurate indoor positioning is reliable beacon data. By implementing these improvements, we can significantly reduce the noise in RSSI readings and ensure that only current, relevant beacon data is used for position calculations. The dynamic scanning approach will also help optimize battery consumption.

### 1.2 Distance Estimation Refinement

**Current Challenges:**
- Simple distance calculation models don't account for environmental factors
- Fixed environmental factor N doesn't provide sufficient accuracy across different spaces

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Implement an adjustable environmental factor N that can be calibrated for specific locations
- Create a calibration interface for field adjustments
- Develop and test multiple propagation models to find the most suitable one for our use case

**Rationale:**
Distance estimation accuracy directly impacts positioning precision. By allowing for environmental calibration and implementing more sophisticated propagation models, we can achieve more accurate distance estimates from RSSI values, which will improve overall positioning accuracy.

### 1.3 Position Calculation Algorithm Enhancement

**Current Challenges:**
- Simple triangulation methods are vulnerable to RSSI fluctuations
- Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) affects accuracy based on beacon placement

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Implement a least squares method for more robust position calculation
- Add GDOP consideration in position calculations
- Develop a weighted approach that gives more importance to more reliable beacons

**Rationale:**
More sophisticated position calculation algorithms can better handle the inherent noise and uncertainty in BLE-based positioning. The least squares method provides a mathematically sound approach to finding the most likely position given multiple, potentially conflicting distance measurements.

## 2. Sensor Fusion Implementation

### 2.1 Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) Development

**Current Challenges:**
- Relying solely on BLE positioning doesn't provide smooth tracking
- Simple threshold-based step detection leads to false positives
- Compass (magnetometer) is unreliable in indoor environments due to magnetic distortions

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Implement robust step detection using peak-valley pattern recognition in accelerometer data
- Develop heading estimation primarily using gyroscope data with complementary filter
- Create dynamic step length estimation based on walking patterns
- Implement relative position tracking using PDR

**Rationale:**
PDR provides continuous position updates between BLE fixes and can maintain positioning when BLE signals are temporarily unavailable. By implementing sophisticated step detection and heading estimation algorithms, we can achieve more reliable PDR, which will complement BLE positioning.

### 2.2 Sensor Fusion Algorithm Implementation

**Current Challenges:**
- BLE positioning and PDR each have their own strengths and weaknesses
- Abrupt position corrections create poor user experience

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Implement weighted averaging for smooth integration of BLE and PDR positioning
- Develop dynamic weighting based on confidence levels of each positioning method
- Consider implementing a Kalman filter for optimal sensor fusion in future iterations

**Rationale:**
Sensor fusion combines the strengths of different positioning methods while minimizing their weaknesses. By implementing a weighted approach that smoothly transitions between BLE and PDR positioning, we can provide a more consistent and accurate positioning experience for users.

## 3. User Interface and Experience Enhancements

### 3.1 Map Display and Interaction

**Current Challenges:**
- Users need intuitive visualization of their position

- Implement map zooming and panning functionality
- Add smooth animations for position updates

**Rationale:**
The map display is the primary interface through which users interact with the positioning system. By implementing these improvements, we can provide a more intuitive and informative visualization of the user's position, including the system's confidence in that position.

### 3.2 User Interface Design

**Current Challenges:**
- UI needs to be intuitive and accessible
- Debug information should be available but not intrusive

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Implement Material3 design components for a modern, consistent UI
- Create a toggleable debug overlay for development and troubleshooting
- Design a clean, uncluttered main interface focused on the map display
- Add user settings for customizing the positioning experience

**Rationale:**
A well-designed UI is essential for user adoption and satisfaction. By implementing these improvements, we can provide a clean, intuitive interface that focuses on the essential information while still providing access to more detailed information when needed.

## 4. System Architecture and Performance Optimization

### 4.1 Architecture Refinement
