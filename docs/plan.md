# Indoor Positioning System Improvement Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for transitioning the current BLE beacon-based indoor positioning system to a Wi-Fi + SLAM approach. The plan is organized by functional areas with clear rationales for each proposed change.

## 1. System Architecture Transformation

### 1.1 Wi-Fi Fingerprinting Module
**Rationale:** Transitioning from BLE beacons to Wi-Fi fingerprinting eliminates the need for additional hardware installation and maintenance, leveraging existing Wi-Fi infrastructure in most buildings.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Develop a Wi-Fi signal strength scanner service to collect RSSI data from nearby access points
- Create algorithms for fingerprint map generation and storage
- Implement position estimation using collected fingerprints (target: 3-5m accuracy)
- Design calibration tools for Wi-Fi signal mapping in different environments

### 1.2 Visual-Inertial SLAM Implementation
**Rationale:** SLAM technology provides centimeter-level precision in tracking relative movement, significantly improving upon the current PDR implementation's accuracy.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Integrate camera access and feature point extraction capabilities
- Develop visual feature tracking algorithms optimized for mobile devices
- Implement motion estimation from camera and IMU sensor fusion
- Create 3D mapping of environment features for improved localization
- Optimize processing for mobile device constraints (CPU, memory, battery)

### 1.3 Sensor Fusion with Extended Kalman Filter
**Rationale:** EKF provides a mathematically sound approach to combining the absolute positioning from Wi-Fi (low frequency, medium accuracy) with the relative positioning from SLAM (high frequency, high precision).

**Proposed Changes:**
- Replace current fusion algorithm with EKF implementation
- Design state prediction model based on SLAM motion vectors
- Implement observation updates from Wi-Fi positioning
- Develop drift correction using Wi-Fi absolute positions
- Tune EKF parameters for optimal performance in various environments

## 2. Performance Optimization

### 2.1 Battery Efficiency
**Rationale:** Indoor positioning systems must operate for extended periods without excessive battery drain to be practical for real-world use.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Implement dynamic scanning intervals based on movement detection
- Add static detection to reduce sensor usage when not moving
- Optimize camera and sensor processing for lower power consumption
- Create a low-power mode for extended usage scenarios
- Implement selective sensor activation based on positioning requirements

### 2.2 Processing Efficiency
**Rationale:** SLAM algorithms are computationally intensive and must be optimized to run efficiently on mobile devices with limited resources.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Optimize feature detection and tracking algorithms for mobile GPUs
- Implement multi-threading for parallel processing of sensor data
- Reduce memory footprint of map data structures
- Implement efficient data structures for fingerprint storage and retrieval
- Profile and optimize critical code paths for reduced CPU usage

## 3. Reliability and Error Handling

### 3.1 Sensor Availability Management
**Rationale:** The system must gracefully handle situations where sensors are unavailable or providing unreliable data.

**Proposed Changes:**
